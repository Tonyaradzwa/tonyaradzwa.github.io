# Title: Generating Hard Math Problems
![](mathematics.jpeg)
## Project Description

This project will focus on training a neural network (NN) to generate a difficult math problem. In order to achieve this, we will need a dataset of math problems. Difficulty itself will need to be defined and its parameters determined i.e. does difficulty mean larger numbers? or problems with solutions that are ad hoc in nature? or perhaps the order in which the variables in the problem are introduced? These are all potential inputs to our neurons. Our definition of difficulty might be limited by our dataset. A dataset with problem-solution pairs will be used, and we will train the NN to generate ouput of the same format. 

Regardless of the results acheieved in this project, we will be able to gain insight that is useful in cryptography, an important area for privacy and security.

## Project Goals
1. Determine our parameters of difficulty.
2. Train the NN to generate a problem-solution pair that matches our standard of difficulty.
