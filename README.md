# Title: Generating Hard Math Problems

![](images/maze-example.png)

## Project Description

I will focus on training neural networks (NNs) to generate a difficult math problem. A dataset of difficult math problems can be found but not in the . Questions to discuss, 
1. How are we going to measure difficulty particularly for this projects. Difficulty could be larger numbers? Difficulty could be problems with solutions that are ad hoc in nature? Moreover, our definition of difficulty will likely be limited by our dataset.
2. We train the NN to generate a problem solution pair (same format as the dataset) 
Regardless of the result of whether the result of this project is achieved, we will be able to get an insight into how to approach the task of generating the math problem. Such insight will be useful useful in cryptography and in decentralized computer systems that use cryptography e.g cryptocurrency and blockchain.

Further research could go into studying the corpus of mathematical terms and seeing which type of problems can 


## Project Goals
1. Determine a measure of difficulty
2. Train the NN to generate a difficult math problem by this standard of difficulty
